# Anomaly_Detection_algorithms

We review machine learning algorithms used for anomaly detection. Among them, we will focus on a Random Forest Classifier, 
an AutoEncoder Neural Network and an Isolation Forest. Since we have the choice to use a GPU for training the autoencoder
I strongly recommend you to open the notebook in Google Colab (you only have to use the link at the top of the notebook),
unless, of course you have already set up your own GPU. Of course, you can choose not to use it, all you have to do
is to set "is_GPU_ON" to False in the "AutoEncoder" function, but it will take significantly more time to train.
Also, the python file is available in case you are not fond of notebooks.
